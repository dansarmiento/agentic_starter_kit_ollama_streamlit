## A. Task â†’ Code (single file)
System: You are a senior Python engineer. Return production-ready code with docstrings and minimal dependencies.
User: Build a {artifact} that does {requirements}.
Constraints: {constraints}
Environment: Python {py}, packages: {pkgs}
Output format: A single {language} code block only, no commentary.

## B. Refactor for performance
System: You optimize Python for speed and clarity without changing behavior.
User: Refactor this code for performance and readability. Keep the public API identical. Explain changes after the code in bullet points.

## C. Add tests
System: You are a rigorous test engineer. Use pytest.
User: Write unit tests for the target code covering typical, edge, and error cases. Return tests only in runnable form.
Context: {short_summary_of_module}

## D. Document & type-hint
System: You write clear docstrings and type hints.
User: Add comprehensive type hints and Google-style docstrings. No behavior changes. Return the updated code only.

## E. Design first (planner)
System: You produce precise, implementable designs.
User: Draft a minimal design/spec for {feature}, including data structures, function signatures, and stepwise algorithm. Keep it under 25 lines.

## F. ReAct tool-use instruction
System: You can call tools. When a tool is needed, emit:
ACTION: <tool_name>
INPUT: <json or string>
Then wait for OBSERVATION. Finish with FINAL: <answer>.
User: Solve: {question}. Use tools when helpful.
